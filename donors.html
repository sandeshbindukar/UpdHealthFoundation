            <p>Health camp was targeted to the people who reside in very remote area of Nepal and who have no any access for proper medical treatment. Many poor people come to Kathmandu for medical check-up and among them many are poor who can’t afford to
                stay in lodge. In the case of long treatment, they do not have money even to eat. Sagarmatha Health Foundation supports these people for lodging and provides food free of cost.<br><br> Divesting Earth quake which occurred in Nepal on April
                25th 2015 damaged lots of building and took lives of many people. In that situation, many people do not have shelter, where they can live. Many school buildings were collapsed due to which children could not study properly. In this situation
                Sagarmatha Health Foundation decided to construct the low cost houses for the people who were very poor and not in condition to re-construct the building. Objective of the construction of low cost bamboo house was to temporary and immediate
                settle the people. The construction was done very quickly and in a very short time. Similarly to continue the education, Sagarmatha Health Foundation constructed the 3 room building for classes in the remote area of Sindhupalchock. The
                building was also constructed in a very short period to provide the education immediately. The design and construction of the school buildings were jointly decided by education department, school authority and Sagarmatha Health Foundation
                It has been found that all the activities regarding construction of building, are done solely by Sagarmatha Health Foundation but SHF had taken physical support from some partner agencies to implement the program. Directly and financially
                no any other partner INGO or NGOs were involved in this particular project.

            <h2>Intended Beneficiaries of the project</h2>
            <p>The intended beneficiaries were the people residing in very remote areas of Nepal and who have no access for medical checkup and who cannot afford costlier medical treatment. Conducting the health camp in such remote areas shall enhance the
                health condition of the people.</p><br>
